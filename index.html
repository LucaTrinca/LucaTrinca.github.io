    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a UBC Engineering Physics student looking for practical experience through 
      Mechanical or Electrical Engineering internships. My strengths are CAD modeling, 
      prototyping, and Arduino-based electronics, with proven teamwork and time 
      management abilities developed through hands-on academic and design projects. 
      I bring strong collaboration, communication, and analytical problem-solving skills, 
      with a drive to apply classroom knowledge to real-world engineering challenges.
