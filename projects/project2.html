      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Motivated by an interest in prosthetics and adaptive devices, I designed and fabricated a 
        <b>Prosthetic Dexterous Hand Extension</b>. Using SolidWorks, I modified an existing prosthetic hand 
        design to improve finger maneuverability and grip efficiency. The enhanced hand was mounted to the end 
        of a shaft, creating an arm extension operated through a system of cables and elastic bands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project served as a <b>mechanical proof-of-concept</b>, exploring the kinematics of prosthetic fingers 
        and the role of material choices in grip performance. While this prototype was mechanically driven, I am 
        considering future iterations that incorporate electrical control systems for enhanced dexterity.

    <!-- Engineering Challenges -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Engineering Challenges & Solutions</h2>

      <h3>Finger Contraction Mechanism</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> The original design only featured a tendon track along the back of each finger, limiting full contraction.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Added a second tendon channel along the inside for contraction, while using the outer channel with elastic cables for extension.</p>

      <h3>Design for Manufacturability</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Precise tolerances were needed around pin holes and moving joints.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Refined the CAD model with appropriate tolerances for smooth motion and real-world manufacturability.</p>

      <h3>Grip Strength Limitations</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Early prototypes slipped with objects heavier than ~200 g.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Applied higher-friction materials to the finger surfaces to reduce slip.</p>

      <h3>Small Object Handling</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Flat palm design limited grasping of narrow objects like pencils.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Modified palm geometry with added material, creating a more natural grip for precision handling.</p>
