    <section class="card">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I designed and fabricated a functional Electric Piano using scrap wood,
        3D-printed components, and an Arduino microcontroller. The wooden frame
        and lever system provided structural support, while custom CAD-modeled
        keys were 3D printed for consistent geometry. Button triggers mounted
        beneath each key served as inputs, and sound output was generated through
        a piezo buzzer controlled by the Arduino.

    <!-- Engineering Challenges -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Engineering Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <h3>Precision in Fabrication</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Accurate measurements were critical to ensure uniform key spacing and reliable lever action.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Refined blueprinting process and learned to take consistently accurate measurements.</p>

      <h3>Polyphony (Multiple Notes)</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Initial attempts limited the piano to a single note.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Implemented the Arduino ‚ÄúMozzi‚Äù audio synthesis library to enable multiple tones.</p>

      <h3>Counterweight Calibration</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Keys would unintentionally trigger due to their weight.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Designed experiments to test counterweights, iterating until optimal balance was found.</p>

      <h3>False Triggering</h3>
      <p><b>Challenge:</b> Mechanical weight and software errors caused unwanted activations.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Combined calibrated counterweights with refined code logic for reliability.</p>
